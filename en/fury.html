            <p id="intro">We are in April 1945 in Germany, aboard the M4A3E8 Sherman tank named Fury, commanded by Sergeant Don Wardaddy. His crew consists of four men: Boyd Swan, Trini Garcia, Grady Travis, and the new recruit, Norman Ellison, who replaces Red, who fell in combat. Together, their mission is to assist Captain Waggoner. He will ask them to clear the way to the next town. A mission that will prove to be highly perilous...</p>
            <img src="/public/img/image/Equipe.webp" >
            <p>Released on October 22, 2014, and directed by David Ayer, Fury is a war film set in the final weeks of World War II. Starring actors like Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, and Jon Bernthal.</p>
            <h1>Characters:</h1>
            <p><strong>Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt):</strong> He is the commander of the M4A3E8 Sherman tank. He is a courageous and determined leader, who can sometimes be ruthless, as seen with Norman at the beginning of the film. However, he has a good heart, as revealed towards the end of the film, as his main concern is keeping his men alive.</p>
            <p><strong>Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf):</strong> He is the tank's gunner. His character is deeply religious and is known for his great precision and dedication, especially in the battle against the German Tiger tank. However, he is also quite emotional and attentive to others.</p>
            <p><strong>Corporal Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Peña):</strong> He is the tank's driver. His character is skilled, and his ability to navigate difficult terrains is crucial for the success of the mission. He is of Mexican origin, which explains why he sometimes speaks Spanish. He is a character with a good heart and is very effective in combat, especially in the maneuvers performed during the battle against the German Tiger tank.</p>
            <p><strong>Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (Jon Bernthal):</strong> He is the tank's loader-mechanic. His character is tough and reliable, and his knowledge of the tank has been more than useful in various repairs to get the tank back in working order, especially at the beginning of the film when he fixes the engine. He is a rather violent, perverse, and tough character, especially towards Norman, but he will eventually become grateful and admiring towards this young recruit.</p>
            <p><strong>Norman Ellison 'Machine' (Logan Lerman):</strong> He is the new co-pilot-gunner who replaces Red, who fell in combat. Despite his inexperience, he must quickly adapt to the brutal reality of war. He is a fragile character at the beginning of the film but becomes increasingly courageous over time. He shows exceptional bravery by being willing to sacrifice himself alongside Sergeant Wardaddy to slow down the enemy.</p>

            <p><strong>-</strong> However, "Fury" also received negative reviews. Some critics pointed out pacing issues that hinder the smooth flow of the film. EcranLarge criticized the character of Logan Lerman, calling him a completely unnecessary addition.</p>
