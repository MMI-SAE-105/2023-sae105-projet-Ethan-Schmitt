            <img src="/public/img/image/David.webp" >
            <h1>Early Life and Beginnings</h1>
            <p>David Ayer spent his adolescence in the tough neighborhood of South Central in Los Angeles. After being kicked out of his family, he lived with his cousin in Los Angeles. His experiences in the neighborhoods of South Central were a source of inspiration for his films.
                At the age of 18, he joined the US Navy as a sonar officer on a submarine. His experience in the Navy inspired his first film screenplay, U-5711.</p>
            <h2>Hollywood Career</h2>
            <p>After his service in the Navy, David Ayer decided to become a screenwriter, largely on the suggestion of his friend and mentor Wesley Strick. His first feature film screenplay, U-571, was directed by Jonathan Mostow and released in 20001. The film revitalized the submarine film genre.
                In 2001, Hollywood witnessed the rise of screenwriter David Ayer. He made his debut with the film "Training Day," directed by Antoine Fuqua. The film, which features an idealistic young police officer (Ethan Hawke) confronted with a corrupt partner (Denzel Washington), was critically acclaimed. Washington's performance earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor in 200212.
                The same year, Ayer demonstrated his versatility by writing the screenplay for "Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift," directed by Rob Cohen3. The film, set in the urban world of street racing, was a resounding success. This confirmed Ayer's talent for telling captivating stories featuring endearing anti-heroes45. These successes firmly established Ayer as a creative force in Hollywood.</p>
            <h4>Transition to Directing</h4>
            <p>In 2005, David Ayer directed his first feature film, Bad Times, starring Christian Bale. The film was inspired by his childhood and youth. Despite mixed reviews, the film was profitable1. He has since directed several other films, including "Fury," which was hailed as a sublime work showing that World War II was not at all foolish2.
                <br>Controversies However, directing "Suicide Squad" in 2016 was a challenging experience for Ayer. Despite fairly mixed feedback from the community, the film made millions of dollars at the box office. However, Ayer expressed his dissatisfaction with the final result of the film, stating in an interview that the film had "broken his heart" and that his dream idea had quickly turned into a nightmare.
                </p>
